## Agile development workflow

### Waterfall model
- Requirements: What should we do?
- Design: What to stack to use?
- Implement: Write the code.
- Testing
- Maintenance

### Agile workflow
- Break the requirement into smaller chunks. A developer will own a part of the overall requirements. 
- Stakeholder gives the requirements.
- Break the requirements into smaller tasks.
- Each person/team gets a task as a part of a sprint.
- Sprints
  - Plan and complete the tasks within a timeframe
  - Time measurement for a job is done in terms of story points. Say for 8 hours/day of work and 30 hours for the task; the task takes 30/8 story points.
  - Scrum boards track the progress of tasks with time.
  - Backlogs are the unfinished tasks from the sprints (after the sprint has finished).
  - Sprint structure
    - One sprint has one epic.
    - One epic has many user stories.
    - One user story has many tasks.
    - One task has many subtasks.
- Agile development workflows prevent over-commitment of time.
- There are no managers, but scrum masters.

### Development approaches
- Domain-driven development (DDD)
- BDD
- Test-driven development (TDD)
